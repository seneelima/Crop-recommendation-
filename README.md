Introduction
Agriculture is very important for the economy and livelihood of many farmers. Yields of all the crops are dependent on weather and soil profile of the land. 
In order to equip the farmers with latest trends in technology and help them to choose the best crops Machine Learning has been used for building Crop recommendation system.
Problem Statement:
Based on multiple parameters like weather in a particular region (rain, humidity) and soil conditions like (ph, N, P, K) content of soil,
crop recommendation system has been developed using Machine Learning, so that farmers can make best choice of crops which will help them to get more yield and increase their income.
